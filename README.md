# California Housing Prices — Univariate Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between median house prices in California and three different factors:  
- Median Income  
- Population  
- Number of Households  

Using simple linear regression models, we explore which of these factors best predicts housing prices. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help decision-makers understand what drives housing costs in different areas.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available and comes from the California Housing Prices data, originally sourced here:  
[California Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html)  

The data includes median house values along with various demographic and housing-related variables for different California neighborhoods.

## What’s Included

- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):**  
  A step-by-step notebook containing data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, visualization, and clear explanations written for non-ML experts.

- **README.md:**  
  This file, describing the project, dataset, and structure.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed, along with necessary packages:  
   - pandas  
   - seaborn  
   - matplotlib  
   - scikit-learn  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in VSCode or Jupyter Notebook/Lab.  
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Insights and Conclusions

- Median Income is the strongest predictor of housing prices among the three factors studied.  
- Population and number of households show weaker relationships with house prices.  
- These insights can help stakeholders focus on income-related factors when assessing housing market dynamics.
